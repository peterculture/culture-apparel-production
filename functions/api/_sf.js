/**
 * Shared Salesforce helper for Cloudflare Pages Functions.
 *
 * Files prefixed with "_" are NOT exposed as routes by Pages, but they can
 * still be imported by the route handlers. This module:
 *   1. Tracks which named Salesforce org ("environment") is currently active,
 *      shared across every request/user via the INVENTORY KV namespace --
 *      see admin/sf-env.js, the endpoint that reads/changes it.
 *   2. Gets an access token from that org using the Client Credentials flow
 *      (server-to-server, no user login, no browser CORS involved).
 *   3. Caches that token PER ENVIRONMENT in the isolate's module scope until
 *      it nears expiry, so switching environments doesn't need to force a
 *      cache-bust -- each org's cache entry lives independently, and a
 *      still-fresh token is reused if you switch back to it.
 *   4. Exposes a small fetch wrapper that retries once on a 401 (expired token).
 *
 * ENVIRONMENTS
 *   SF_ENVIRONMENTS below is the fixed list of selectable orgs. Each one
 *   needs its own credential triplet in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard
 *   (Settings -> Variables and Secrets), named with that environment's key
 *   UPPERCASED:
 *     SF_ENV_DEV2_LOGIN_URL        e.g. https://YOURDOMAIN--dev2.sandbox.my.salesforce.com
 *     SF_ENV_DEV2_CLIENT_ID        Consumer Key from that org's Connected/External Client App
 *     SF_ENV_DEV2_CLIENT_SECRET    Consumer Secret (mark encrypted/secret)
 *   ...and the same three, suffixed _STAGING / _PRODUCTION, for the other
 *   entries in SF_ENVIRONMENTS. An environment with any of its three vars
 *   missing is reported as unconfigured (see isEnvConfigured) and can't be
 *   switched to -- "production" ships here as a placeholder with no
 *   credentials yet, on purpose, until that org exists.
 *
 *   SF_API_VERSION   optional, defaults to v60.0 -- shared across all
 *                    environments (not org-specific in practice).
 *
 *   SF_ZK_ORDER_FIELD_ID_<ENV>   Id of the zkmulti__MCShipment__c.Order__c
 *                    custom lookup field in that org (see
 *                    orders/[id]/zk-wizard-url.js's header comment for how
 *                    to find it -- it's a real per-org metadata Id, not
 *                    something that migrates with a change set). Falls back
 *                    to the unsuffixed SF_ZK_ORDER_FIELD_ID if the suffixed
 *                    var isn't set, since dev2 and Staging happen to share
 *                    the same value today (confirmed 2026-07-27 -- both
 *                    sandboxes trace back to the same lineage).

/**
 * Runs one SOQL query and follows Salesforce's pagination (done/

 *
 * Salesforce's /query endpoint only returns up to one "batch" per call (2000
 * records by default, sometimes fewer depending on org settings). A larger
 * result comes back with `done: false` and a `nextRecordsUrl` you're
 * expected to re-fetch, repeatedly, until `done: true`. Every endpoint in
 * this app used to read `data.records` straight off the FIRST response only
 * -- fine while result sets stayed under the batch size, but a silent,
 * no-error truncation waiting to happen the moment one didn't (see
 * production-orders/index.js's Order__r.Status = 'Complete' clause, which
 * has no date bound and only grows over the life of the shop). Added
 * 2026-07-29 so every list endpoint gets this for free instead of each
 * needing its own copy of the follow-the-link loop.
 *
 * `nextRecordsUrl` comes back from Salesforce already in the
 * "/services/data/vNN.0/query/<locator>" shape sfFetch expects, so it's
 * passed straight through as the next call's `path`.
 *
 * Returns { ok, status, records, data } where `data` is the LAST response
 * received (matching what a raw sfFetch+resp.json() caller used to get, so
 * error logging/shape stays the same) and `records` is the full
 * concatenated array. If any page after the first fails, stops there and
 * returns what was already collected rather than losing it -- callers that
 * care can inspect `ok`/`status` from that failed page.

/* ── SOQL string literals ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Every query in this app is built by concatenation, so anything that reaches a
   quoted literal has to be escaped. Until 2026-08-31 there were SEVEN copies of
   that job and they did not agree:

     - `q()` in _rework.js, rework-check.js, run-results/index.js,
       shortfalls/index.js and run-line-items/index.js STRIPPED apostrophes
       (replace(/'/g, "")) and passed backslashes straight through.
     - `soqlEscape()` in plans/index.js and presses/index.js escaped both,
       correctly.

   Stripping is safe against breakout -- you cannot reopen a literal with no
   quotes in it -- but it is lossy, and it left a real hole: a value ending in a
   BACKSLASH escapes the closing quote, so `WHERE OrderNumber = 'x\'` runs off
   the end of the literal and the whole query dies as a parse error. The one
   caller-reachable path was /api/rework-check?orderNumber=..., which takes free
   text and (unlike orderId) has no shape check to hide behind.

   ORDER MATTERS: backslash first, then apostrophe. Escaping the quote first
   would then have its own backslash doubled and the escape would be undone.

   Escaping rather than stripping also fixes a quiet bug: an order number or
   press name containing an apostrophe used to be silently mangled into
   something that matched nothing. It now matches itself.

   This is NOT a licence to interpolate user input. Ids still get shape-checked
   against SF_ID before they go anywhere near a WHERE clause -- see
   production-methods/index.js. This is the second lock, not the first. */

 * and the failure is not a friendly SOQL error -- it is an HTTP-level rejection
 * of a request that never became a query. Callers that build an IN list from a
 * result set therefore have to chunk, because a result set is only ever
