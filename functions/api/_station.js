/**
 * Station auth + config for the shop-worker dashboard.  Mirrors how _sf.js
 * abstracts Salesforce auth: shared plumbing that the station endpoints import.
 *
 * THE MODEL
 *   A worker at a station tablet POSTs the station's PIN to /api/station-login.
 *   If the PIN matches, we hand back a SIGNED token in an HttpOnly cookie. Every
 *   station endpoint (schedule read, status write) then verifies that token
 *   server-side and resolves which station the caller is. The browser can't
 *   forge or edit the token because it's HMAC-signed with a secret only the
 *   Worker knows -- so "station=ink" can't just be typed into a cookie.
 *
 * SECRETS (set in the Cloudflare Pages project settings, NEVER in the repo)
 *   STATION_TOKEN_SECRET  a long random string used to sign/verify tokens
 *   STATION_PINS          JSON map of station -> PIN, e.g. {"ink":"4821"}
 *
 * This is APP-level auth. It is NOT a replacement for the Cloudflare Access
 * lockdown: Access still belongs in front of /api/* so the raw endpoints aren't
 * publicly reachable at all. Defense in depth, not either/or -- and the write
 * endpoint especially must not go live until Access is on.
