/**
 * Shared helper: mirror each Production_Method__c's own "Pre-Production

 * name (Design_Received__c, Screens_Completed__c, Mix_Inks__c, Digitize_File__c,
 * Thread_Color_Materials__c, Transfers_Received__c, Transfers_Ready__c --
 * still writable via orders/[id].js's ALLOWED_FIELDS for any caller reading
 * the Order directly, e.g. a standard Salesforce page layout or report).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-22): the 2026-07-21 per-method migration moved
 * these checklist booleans onto Production_Method__c and, correctly, stopped
 * treating the Order copy as the source of truth for the web boards. But the
 * Order fields are the SAME Salesforce fields they always were -- nothing
 * ever taught them to follow their new per-method counterparts, so an item
 * completing (or a manager checking the box on a method card) now updates
 * Production_Method__c and leaves the Order-level checkbox stuck at whatever
 * it last was. This closes that gap the same way rollupOrderSubstatus above
 * keeps Order_Substatus__c honest: recompute from the methods, write to Order,
 * best-effort.
 *
 * ONE ORDER FIELD PER METHOD TYPE: an order can carry siblings of different
 * types (Screen Print + Heat Press), and each checklist field only means
 * something for ONE type (Screens_Completed__c is Screen-Print-only, for
 * example) -- every Production_Method__c carries all 7 fields regardless of
 * its own type (see CHECKLIST_FIELDS in production-methods/[id].js), but the
 * UI only ever shows/toggles the 2-3 relevant to that method's type, so an
 * unrelated sibling's always-false default must NOT drag the Order field
 * down. Scoped per field to just the sibling methods of its matching type;
 * the Order value is TRUE only when EVERY one of those siblings is TRUE (AND,
 * not OR) -- the same "least advanced wins" spirit as the substatus rollup,
 * just applied to booleans. A field with no matching-type sibling on this
 * order (e.g. Screens_Completed__c on an order with only a Heat Press method)
 * has nothing to roll up and is left alone rather than forced to false.
 * Cancelled methods are excluded, same as the substatus rollup above.
 *
 * NOTE (2026-08-10): Films_Printed__c was renamed to Design_Received__c
 * (API name, not just label -- on both Order and Production_Method__c, in
 * both dev2 and Staging) -- the shop no longer prints film; art now goes
 * straight onto an exposure unit that burns the emulsion directly, so this
 * field now tracks whether the customer's art has arrived. Same rollup
 * behavior as before, just following the field's new real name -- see
 * ca-api.js's CHECK_FIELD.
