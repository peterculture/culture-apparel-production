/**
 * GET /api/orders
 *
 * Powers the Pre-Production board (pre-production.html) and the Garment
 * station. Production_Method__c -- NOT Order -- is the root of this query,
 * same shape as /api/production-orders (see that file for the full
 * rationale). Every row already IS a board card: it's gated on its own
 * Status__c = 'Pre-Production' and carries every order-level field a card
 * needs, pulled through the Order__r relationship. Rows are grouped into
 * an order-shaped payload afterward purely for DISPLAY -- Order is a
 * grouping label here, not a gate. An order with a Screen Print method
 * still in Pre-Production and a Heat Press method already further along
 * shows up with just the one relevant card, independent of its sibling.
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE (2026-07-22): matches /api/production-orders for
 * consistency -- both boards now key off Production_Method__c.Status__c
 * exclusively, and neither depends on Order.Order_Substatus__c (a rolled-up
 * field, see _pm-rollup.js) to decide what's fetched. pre-production.html
 * already filtered cards client-side by `pm.Status__c === 'Pre-Production'`
 * before this change, so this doesn't change what's visible -- it just
 * stops over-fetching every order in the whole pipeline (Ready for Print
 * through Completed) only to discard most of it client-side, and stops
 * relying on Order_Substatus__c altogether.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE ENDPOINT FROM /api/production-orders: that one filters on
 * Production_Method__c.Status__c IN ('Ready for Print', 'In Production',
 * 'Post-Production', 'Completed') for the Production Dashboard. This one
 * filters on Status__c = 'Pre-Production' for the Pre-Production
 * Dashboard/Garment station. They're deliberately non-overlapping.
