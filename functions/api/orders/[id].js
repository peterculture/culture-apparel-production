// NOTE (2026-07-22): this endpoint used to cascade any checklist box checked
// TRUE here down onto matching Pre_Production_Item__c records. That cascade
// was built against the OLD shared, order-level checklist -- since the
// 2026-07-21 per-method migration, checklist toggles are written per
// Production_Method__c via production-methods/[id].js, which now owns the
// (correctly method-scoped) cascade itself; see ../_ppi-checklist.js. The
// legacy order-level checklist fields below are still writable through this
// endpoint for any other caller, but no cascade runs off them anymore -- a
// stale cascade scoped to Production_Method__c off an Order Id would just
// silently match nothing, which is worse than no cascade at all.

  //
  // This one has more reach than anything else on this list. Print_Date__c
  // drives card order on BOTH boards, prepBufferStats()'s Prep Time KPI, and
  // the urgency term of the priority score itself -- so a drag genuinely
  // re-prioritises the order it moved. That feedback is intended (a job pushed
  // later IS less urgent) and is why a dragged run is stamped
  // Auto_Scheduling_Status__c = 'Confirmed': the suggestion engine stops
  // proposing a slot for it, so the board cannot appear to argue with the
  // manager who just moved it.

  // start -- an order begins printing when its first run does.

   "Local Dropoff" was removed from this set on 2026-08-28. It is NOT a stored
   value: it is the on-screen LABEL of the entry stored as "Delivery" (the same
   label/value split as Order_Substatus__c's "In Production"/"Production" pair
   above). Accepting it here let the browser send a display label all the way to
   Salesforce, which then rejected the whole PATCH with
   INVALID_OR_NULL_FOR_RESTRICTED_PICKLIST -- a failed save reported as a
   Salesforce error rather than as the bad input it was. Rejecting it here
   returns bad_delivery_method and names the caller as the problem.

   The browser no longer has a way to send it either: index.html's drawer builds
   its options from CAApi.deliveryOptions(). This set is the backstop, not the
